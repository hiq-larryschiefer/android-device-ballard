This is a sample platform SDK add-on which modifies/extends the core system framework without
violating the CDD.  The extensions are hidden from the public Android API, but are exposed via
the new, custom platform SDK.

Yes, it does violate the recommendations from the presentation this was used in for AnDevCon
Boston, 2013!  The reasons why this was done are:

1. To show that it can be done and not violate CDD
2. To show how easy it is to do this an create potential security holes
3. To demonstrate the concept of the presentation in a simple, straightforward way
   and have it fit in an hour and 15 minute talk!
